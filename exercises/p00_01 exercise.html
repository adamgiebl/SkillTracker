  <h1 class="description">A Walk in the Park</h1>
  <h1 class="subdescription">Download and unpack starter_files</h1>

  <p>This exercise is the very first in the <em>Walk in the Park</em> track, and the only thing you have to do,
    is to download the zip file: <a href="http://petlatkea.dk/2020/basicanimation/walk_in_the_park.zip">walk_in_the_park.zip</a>
    and unpack it to the folder on your own machine, where you will keep the library of tiny exercises and examples.</p>
    <p>The first three exercises are already included - and for future exercises, you'll simply have to add more files into the same folder.</p>

  <p>Enjoy, and don't worry - <em>it's going to be a walk in the park ...</em></p>
