  <h1 class="description">Exercise - Add and remove animations</h1>
  <h1 class="subdescription">add animations to the CoinClicker game</h1>

  <p>You are going to implement my Coinclicker-game, but in very small steps. In this exercise you just have to play a bit around with <code>querySelector</code> and <code>classList</code>
  - in the following exercises you are going to build something more useful.</p>
  <p>Download the zip-file: <a href="http://petlatkea.dk/2020/basicanimation/coinclicker_mini_starterfiles.zip" download><code>coinclicker_mini.zip</code></a> and unpack it to your exercises folder.</p>
  <p>Add a <code>script.js</code> file, and use a <code>console.log</code> to verify that it runs.</p>
  <p>Then use <code>querySelector</code> and <code>classList</code> to achieve the following results &ndash; you might want to comment out some results, to avoid conflicts.</p>
  <p>You should only add classes with JavaScript - you can try to turn them off and on with the inspector .cls tool, though.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Make the first coin - <code>#coin_container1</code> fall continuously</li>
    <li>Make the second coin - <code>#coin_container2</code> also fall continuously, but add a different speed to it</li>
    <li>Pause the first coin - use the inspector to "un-pause" it for a while, so it shows up, then pause it again with the inspector.</li>
    <li>Make the third coin (the sprite) zoom in, as if it was clicked</li>
    <li>Make the bomb "explode" - there's missing a keyframe animation for this - so you need to create one!</li>
    <li>Make the entire game "shake" as an effect of the explosion</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  You are going to re-use all the results in a later exercise, so don't throw them away!</p>
