  <h1 class="description">Exercise - Building functions</h1>
  <h1 class="subdescription">create the functions for the CoinClicker game</h1>

  <p>You are going to implement my Coinclicker-game, but in very small steps.
    In the last exercise you played a bit around with <code>querySelector</code> and <code>classList</code>, and got something moving
    on the screen. - In this exercise, you are going to create some of the functions for use in the game.</p>
    <p>Most of the functions will use some of the code-lines you have already written, so continue working in the same project!</p>
  <p>Create the following functions, one at a time. Everytime you have written a function, call it from the inspector/console, by going
    to your browser, and type the name of the function, followed by a set of parantheses ().</p>
    <p>Include a <code>console.log</code> line in each function, so you get feedback that it runs, even if you can't see the result on the screen.</p>
  
  <hr>
  <p>Create these functions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><code>startBomb()</code> that starts the bomb falling continuously.</li>
    <li><code>startCoins()</code> that starts all three coins falling, with at least two different speeds.</li>
    <li><code>pauseCoin1()</code> that pauses the falling of just the first coin</li>
    <li><code>coin2Clicked()</code> that pauses the falling of coin2, <strong>and</strong> zooms it as if it was clicked.</li>
    <li><code>bombClicked()</code> that pauses the falling of the bomb, and makes it explode</li>
    <li><code>explosion()</code> that causes the screen to shake</li>
    <li><code>bombRestart()</code> that removes the explosion from the bomb, and unpauses it</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>
  <p>
  If you finish quickly, feel free to also add similar function for the other coins, and the heart.<br>
  You are going to re-use all the results in a later exercise, so don't throw them away!</p>
