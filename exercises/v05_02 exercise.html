  <h1 class="description">Exercise - Build the CoinClicker mini game</h1>
  <h1 class="subdescription">- just clicking, and changing animations</h1>

  <p>You are going to implement my Coinclicker-game, but in very small steps.<br>
    In the last exercise you built a lot of functions, and now it is time to add some structure, and chain them together, so the game
    can be "played".<br>
    At least the user should be able to click on coin2 and make it appear as if it went into the score - or click the bomb,
    and make it explode and shake the screen.<br>
    A fun game!</p>
    
  <p>Use this <a href="http://petlatkea.dk/2020/basicanimation/StateMachineDiagram-CoinClicker_mini.pdf">State Machine Diagram</a> for the structure of the game. You will notice that you already have most of the 
  functions, so it is just a matter of adding and removing the correct event listeners.<br>
  When you are done, there should be no need to type anything in the console, the game should start and run by itself.</p>  
  
  <p>Note that you might want to check up on how to restart animations!</p>
  
  <hr>

  <p>When you are done, you can follow a similar procedure for your own game - and remember, it is just about getting something moving and clicking.</p>
