  <h1 class="description">Exercise - Win money, lose lives</h1>
  <h1 class="subdescription">Make the CoinClicker mini game show score and hearts</h1>

  <p>You are going to implement my Coinclicker-game, but in very small steps.<br>
    In the last exercise, you counted coins and lives, when the player clicked various items. In this exercise you
    are going to add a visual display of the players score (the total number of points) and lives.</p>
    
  <p>There are only two requirements:</p>I
  <ol><li>
    Show the number of coins as a number in the upper right corner
  </li>
<li>
  Show the number of lives, as a list of hearts. There should always be three hearts in total. If a life is lost, that heart becomes "broken". When a life is regained, the broken heart becomes normal again. The hearts should be broken from the right hand side.
</li></ol>
<p>You will encounter errors when the player gets more than three, or less than zero lives. That is okay for this exercise!
  Just pretend that the situation will never arise, when the player has -1 or fewer lives.
</p>

    If you are up for it, you can combine this version with the last CoinClicker mini with animations, and make an almost complete game. But only do that as an extra exercise - think of your own game first.
