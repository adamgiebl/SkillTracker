  <h1 class="description">Exercise - Count points and lives</h1>
  <h1 class="subdescription">Expand the CoinClicker mini game with counters</h1>

  <p>You are going to implement my Coinclicker-game, but in very small steps. In previous exercises you added animations and events. For this version you don't have to worry about animations, but purely on the UI.<br>
    <p>Download the zip-file: <a href="http://petlatkea.dk/2020/basicanimation/coinclicker_score_starterfiles.zip" download><code>coinclicker_score.zip</code></a> and unpack it to your exercises folder.</p>
    <p>If you really want to, you can work with your existing files - just add the ui_elements from the HTML, and the few lines of CSS that sets it up. You also need the broken-heart.svg file. There are no other changes to the basic game.</p>
    
  <p>Add a <code>script.js</code> file, and use a <code>console.log</code> to verify that it runs.</p>
  <p>Then create event listeners on all the game_elements, the coins, the bomb and the heart.</p>
  <p>When you have the event listeners up and running, add variables to keep track of points and lives.</p>
  <p>In this version, just <code>console.log</code> the variables when they change.</p>
  <p>The rules for the game are as follows:</p>
  <hr>
  <ul><li>The player starts with 3 lives, and 0 points</li>
    <li>When a coin is clicked, the player earns 1 point</li>
    <li>When a bomb is clicked, the player loses a life</li>
    <li>When a heart is clicked, the player gains a life</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this version, don't worry about getting a negative number of lives.</p>
    
    
  <p>
  You are going to re-use all the results in a later exercise, so don't throw them away!</p>
